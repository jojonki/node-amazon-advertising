Amazon Advertising API Web Service with Node.js
---

This is a web application which uses Amazon's [Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html) with Node.js.


How to use?
------
This repositry does not contain node_modules. So you have to install modules before starting this app.

```
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

node modules
------
Please see package.json. I use express, ejs and apac npm modules, and also use grunt modules for developping.
